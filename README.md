To My Students: 

The code snippets in this repository are for use on your semester projects. By no means are these the ONLY way to bulit an interactive web page. YOu may have noticed earlier versions of exercises that used inline styles, or even styles in the head of the page, rather than an external style sheet. 

The reason I'm recommending that you get used to using an external styles.css file to control your web page is that I want you to get used to how external style sheets function, because this is the way that modern web design is accomplished - and these are the kinds of files you will be running into when you have to customize a WordPress site. 

WARNING: If you have not already cleanly and clearly defined the site root folder, using the site setup process that I led you through in class, you will have a difficult time using the CSS styles I am providing here.
